# Interest-Calculator

This program calculates the projection for the user's chosen investment amount over the user's chosen number of years to invest. The user will be told how much money they have at the start of each year, how much they have earned for the year and the total amount of money they have at the end of the year.

## Example:  

John has Â£500 to invest. There is a mutual fund plan that pays 10%
interest annually, compounded quarterly. That is, every three months,
the principal is multiplied by 2.5% (the 10% annual rate divided by 4
because it is compounded 4 times per year) and the result is added to the
principal.

This program will tell John how much money will be in the fund after a specified number of years.
